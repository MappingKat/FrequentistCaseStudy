Frequentist Inference Case Study (A) and (B)
============================================

This repository contains two Jupyter Notebook files: "Frequentist Inference Case Study (A).ipynb" and "Frequentist Inference Case Study (B).ipynb". These notebooks are part of a case study on frequentist inference.

Frequentist Inference Case Study (A).ipynb
------------------------------------------
The "Frequentist Inference Case Study (A).ipynb" notebook provides an in-depth analysis of frequentist inference techniques. It covers various concepts and methods used in frequentist statistics, including hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, p-values, and z-tests. The notebook presents these concepts through practical examples and explains the step-by-step process of performing frequentist inference on real-world data.

Frequentist Inference Case Study (B).ipynb
------------------------------------------
The "Frequentist Inference Case Study (B).ipynb" notebook is a continuation of the case study on frequentist inference. It delves further into the topic and explores additional techniques and scenarios. The notebook covers topics such as t-tests, chi-square tests, ANOVA, and non-parametric tests. Similar to the first notebook, it provides detailed explanations and demonstrates the application of these techniques using real-world datasets.
